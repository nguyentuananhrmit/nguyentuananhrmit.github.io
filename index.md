I took the class with the topic is welcome to the SSE&T class, which gave me much important information regarding my studies and future work. First, Dr. Jonathan Crellin introduced me to engineering-related subjects at RMIT. In particular, IT and software engineering are two fields that we find very difficult to distinguish because they have many similar features and functions, so the teacher spends much time explaining and giving me information about those two areas. After receiving that information, I realize that although these two industries have many similar elements, the core nature is entirely different. IT focuses on improving and upgrading existing software to make them more modern and convenient.
On the other hand, software engineering will be concerned with the production, creation, and development of entirely new software or from the essential software. Next, the lecture deals with the issue of doing an internship before receiving an official university degree. The teacher gave us names of tech companies that we might be interning. It helps me to have a clear direction about the company I want to work for in the future. In addition, it also creates motivation and confidence for me to work hard and continue to improve myself and absorb new knowledge at RMIT. Third, the teacher introduced me to the subjects available in the IT field. He also gave me background information about the subjects we would take in my first year and the number of credits I have to complete in a course. Especially at RMIT, students must complete introductory courses to be eligible for advanced courses. This information will help me better understand what I will be learning in my first year and be able to plan my studies soon. Finally, Dr. Jonathan Crellin reminds us of the school's management regulations in students' learning process. Plagiarism is one of the acts the university will severely punish, and he also gave me examples of plagiarism. Students who make such mistakes may fail the course or be expelled. They are one of those valuable pieces of information that I must always keep in mind because if I get it wrong, it can directly affect my learning. At the same time, I can also find a solution to prevent plagiarism from that information.

I plan to review paraphrasing as it is one of the essential skills in the third session of analytical thinking and effective written communication. Moreover, it is one of the solutions to help me avoid plagiarism and my vocabulary. I will spend a week practicing this skill. I will spend a week practicing this skill. Every day I will write two essays related to technology news in the Washington Post and the New York times. After reading, I will try to apply paraphrasing skills to write a new article but keep the original meaning and content. I hope after a week, I can improve my paraphrasing skill.

I started the class on August 29, 2022, with content on critical thinking and effective written communication. Peter Farrell was the teacher who directly led that session. The lesson has two important and valuable contents: the skill of writing an argument and paraphrasing skill. First, I will cover the skill of writing an argument. After listening to the lecture, I realized that this skill is used to convince and prove to the reader that my point of view is correct. In addition, to write a good and reputable argument, we need to have three main components: an example, evidence, and supporting the idea. In particular, the citation is necessary for an argument because it shows the reader that my views are based on precise data and research. 
Next, paraphrasing is a critical skill in the essay writing process. Because it helps me avoid plagiarism and shows that I have understood the knowledge and researched my way. Moreover, this skill also helps me to improve my vocabulary. In particular, the teacher introduced me to the "chunking" method when performing paraphrasing skills. The method will divide the passage into parts to make it easier to practice paraphrasing skills and ensure that requirements such as changing structure and vocabulary but keeping the original meaning.


## Action Plan

I will practice writing an essay that involves debating an issue related to artificial intelligence. A typical topic is "will the development of AI bring many benefits to people, or will they make people gradually become unemployed and lazy." I will go to Scholar to search for AI research articles related to that topic. Also, I practice quoting and paraphrasing skills while doing my essay. After I finish, I will go to the SAS room to ask the teachers to comment on the essay. I hope that in a week, I will finish the essay and simultaneously master the skill of paraphrasing.

I attended two sessions with Engagement & Effective Oral Communication and Collaboration and Teamwork. First, I will talk about Engagement & Effective Oral Communication. This content will focus on how to make a good presentation. Identifying the audience is one of the critical factors in giving a presentation because this is the process that helps the presenter determine the level of the audience and, based on that, choose the suitable language to help the listeners readily absorb the information that the presenter wants to provide. In addition, the preparation of content and structure also contributes to a coherent and highly effective presentation. A perfect presentation should have five parts: introduction, procedure, results, decision, and conclusion.
Moreover, the slide design makes it easy for listeners to follow and absorb the content. During the slide design process, the presenter needs to pay attention to the font size, the background color, and the presentation of the information on the slide. 
To continue, I will analyze the content of Collaboration and Teamwork. Teamwork is one of the most beneficial methods for a project and each team member. First, in the process of working, we often face many challenges and difficulties, so if we work independently, it usually takes us much time to find solutions to solve complex problems. However, the time will be shortened if we work in a team. Furthermore, at the same time, the quality of the solutions is guaranteed. Moreover, working in groups will help our project achieve higher results because they will have diverse and rich opinions from individuals in the group, from which we can choose the best ideas.


## Action Plan

Next week, I have a presentation on information security, so I will apply the knowledge and methods to give a good presentation that Peter gave earlier. First, I will create a google Doc and add all the group members. I will spend a day creating a content structure for the presentation with clear criteria and complete content. Next, I will spend two days designing the slides for the presentation and, at the same time, collecting each individual's opinion to make the session perfect. I hope the group presentation goes well.
