I took the class with the topic is welcome to the SSE&T class, which gave me much important information regarding my studies and future work. First, Dr. Jonathan Crellin introduced me to engineering-related subjects at RMIT. In particular, IT and software engineering are two fields that we find very difficult to distinguish because they have many similar features and functions, so the teacher spends much time explaining and giving me information about those two areas. After receiving that information, I realize that although these two industries have many similar elements, the core nature is entirely different. IT focuses on improving and upgrading existing software to make them more modern and convenient.
On the other hand, software engineering will be concerned with the production, creation, and development of entirely new software or from the essential software. Next, the lecture deals with the issue of doing an internship before receiving an official university degree. The teacher gave us names of tech companies that we might be interning. It helps me to have a clear direction about the company I want to work for in the future. In addition, it also creates motivation and confidence for me to work hard and continue to improve myself and absorb new knowledge at RMIT. Third, the teacher introduced me to the subjects available in the IT field. He also gave me background information about the subjects we would take in my first year and the number of credits I have to complete in a course. Especially at RMIT, students must complete introductory courses to be eligible for advanced courses. This information will help me better understand what I will be learning in my first year and be able to plan my studies soon. Finally, Dr. Jonathan Crellin reminds us of the school's management regulations in students' learning process. Plagiarism is one of the acts the university will severely punish, and he also gave me examples of plagiarism. Students who make such mistakes may fail the course or be expelled. They are one of those valuable pieces of information that I must always keep in mind because if I get it wrong, it can directly affect my learning. At the same time, I can also find a solution to prevent plagiarism from that information.

I plan to review paraphrasing as it is one of the essential skills in the third session of analytical thinking and effective written communication. Moreover, it is one of the solutions to help me avoid plagiarism and my vocabulary. I will spend a week practicing this skill. I will spend a week practicing this skill. Every day I will write two essays related to technology news in the Washington Post and the New York times. After reading, I will try to apply paraphrasing skills to write a new article but keep the original meaning and content. I hope after a week, I can improve my paraphrasing skill.

Analytical Thinking and Effective Written Communication on Thursday, presented by a guest lecturer. At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher gave us some research results on this topic. The teacher then divides the class members into small groups to discuss the definition and benefits of this method. In addition, we have to conduct some activities like choosing the best argument from the available arguments on the table. Furthermore, the teacher gave each group a piece of paper on the development of artificial intelligence and found the arguments against it so that we could practice writing argumentative paragraphs.

Then the teacher gave us four articles to figure out the concepts needed to create a composite passage. At the beginning of the class, I was surprised by the guest teacher because he had taught me the previous course. The teacher's enthusiasm and friendliness to the class members created a practical and positive learning session. Analytical Thinking and Effective Written Communication are valuable content for me because they will improve my analytical ability at work and my public speaking skills. Also, he advised me to keep citation methods and paraphrasing skills in mind to avoid plagiarism while writing essays and in software engineering courses. Moreover, my paraphrasing skills also help me improve my vocabulary.

I will practice writing an essay that involves debating an issue related to artificial intelligence. A typical topic is "will the development of AI bring many benefits to people, or will they make people gradually become unemployed and lazy." I will go to Scholar to search for AI research articles related to that topic. Also, I practice quoting and paraphrasing skills while doing my essay. After I finish, I will go to the SAS room to ask the teachers to comment on the essay. I hope that in a week, I will finish the essay and simultaneously master the skill of paraphrasing.

A guest teacher presented engagement and Effective Oral Communication. Firstly, the teacher gave me three main points to study this topic. 
Then, everyone gets together to discuss why we should prepare for a presentation and analyze each of the benefits of each preparation. Next, he mentioned the next part of the presentation. We will work in groups to discuss audience types.
Moreover, the teacher asked each group to analyze and point out the salient features of the audience with three different levels: low, medium, and high. In addition, teachers asked us to work with our classmates to identify critical elements of content preparation and organization. In addition, he mentioned the slide. The students worked together to list the common mistakes in the PowerPoint design process and find solutions to overcome those errors. The teacher gives five examples to absorb the lecture in the best way, and the student's task is to find the mistakes in those examples. Finally, he showed two videos of the opening and closing of the presentation for the students to identify the speaker's good points and the flaws that needed to be fixed. The class was lively because of the enthusiasm of the teachers and the friendliness of the class members. Content will help me feel confident when expressing my opinion. In the slide design section, the teacher gave specific methods to improve PowerPoint to help viewers quickly absorb the content and attract viewers. In particular, the teacher advised me to memorize presentation skills to gradually improve myself and get high marks in group presentations at university.



## Action Plan 3

Next week, I have a presentation on information security, so I will apply the knowledge and methods to give a good presentation that Peter gave earlier. First, I will create a google Doc and add all the group members. I will spend a day creating a content structure for the presentation with clear criteria and complete content. Next, I will spend two days designing the slides for the presentation and, at the same time, collecting each individual's opinion to make the session perfect. I hope the group presentation goes well.

In Thursday's fifth week of the course, Jonathan Crellin introduced me to Human Factor. I started the class with knowledge related to human characteristics. Then the teacher went on to provide me with some specific three aspects related to the limitation of human knowledge. Next, the teacher gave me information related to human memory. To make these things more accessible for everyone to absorb, the teacher asked class members to discuss the difference between short-term and long-term memory. In addition, the teacher performed an activity to test how many digits each individual could remember.
Moreover, the class members had to recall their memories to answer questions about their 10th birthday. In particular, the teacher introduced us to the Model Human Processor from Moran and Newell. We do some Stroop testing through operations that dictate the color of words without making mistakes. In the end, Jonathan Crellin showed two videos on Youtube. The first video is called The Monkey Business Illusion. While watching this video, we have to count the number of balls passed by the person in the white shirt. The second video is about the illusion of Ames Windows. This video shows the 092 British Midlands Air crash due to problems with both aircraft engines. During the class, I felt that the lecture was complicated to understand. But thanks to the enthusiastic explanation of the teacher and the friends around. Therefore, I understood the entire content of the lecture. Especially the knowledge about the difference between short-term and long-term memory has helped me better understand the human brain. In addition, the human blind spot, eye anatomy, and how we perceive illusions are the things that have intrigued me and also created a great motivation for me to learn and do more research by how to find research articles related to them or watch on Youtube.


## Action Plan 4

I plan to do more research on the difference between short-term wisdom and long-term wisdom. My goal is to enhance and supplement scientific knowledge related to people. I will spend about two hours each day researching this topic. I will visit Scholar to find more research papers on this topic. Also, I will watch videos on this topic on Youtube. I hope I will gain new knowledge on this topic after a week.



## Action Plan ( After Course )

I will review and research deeper into this course's knowledge, Introduction to Science and Technology, as how to create a GitHub application website to send reflective blogs after I finish my weeks of classes. In addition, I will also review old knowledge related to methods of avoiding plagiarism and presentation skills. For the study plan, I will spend two weeks improving my presentation skills by following the steps and applying the teacher's methods in this course. In addition, I plan to learn coding skills with the programming language Java. For this purpose, I will search for documents related to this programming language to learn and study more deeply.
Moreover, I will join clubs that are related to IT to learn more experience and methods to master this programming language. In particular, when I have difficulties in the process of learning, I will ask for help and advice from teachers. I hope that after three months, I will master this programming language.
